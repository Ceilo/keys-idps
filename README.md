``Personal Intrusion Detection Botnet Mitigation Program``


I am working on a multitude of scripts across different programs to innovate cyber security advancements, learning, education, and knowledge for people everywhere.

All my projects that are involved in this will get added to my pins on my profile. 

THIS project will remain a .readme until a full project realese or until licensing is applied properly.



This project is to do exactly what it says, mitigate and detect botnet intrusions before they even come. THe inspiration behind this project is because I got attacked by meris botnet via linux(it was fine it was on my VM) but to ensure this can't happen again I wanted a personal botnet IDPS and upon searching I realized that all of them happen to just be NOTHING but DEMOS or sign-ups and we will contact you. Which that is great and all. BUT NOT WHEN MY PC IS GETTING JACKED BY RANSOMWARE.
After mitigating the botnet away from my PC I decided to go a bit more out of my way to ensure all users know how to stay safe in the cyber world. 

I was doing nothing when my pc got added to the bot net also, I wasn't even in the room when it happened. I came back to this 5 minutes after leaving my pc. I had no idea how this was happening but it was real. Then I realized I was using a scuffed LINUX kernal through VM and had instant signs of relief-ish..

SO I will continue to work on mitigation tools for personal use and for discord bot integrations so stay tuned. 

IF you would like to collaberate, sponsor, have any types of questions or need help or can maybe you can help me - alwys feel free to reach out.
